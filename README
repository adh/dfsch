This is dfsch - dfox's scheme implementation. It's essentialy an
embeddable scheme interpreter. For now it's still lacking many
scheme functions, but it's generally usable as embedded scripting
language.

Also, for now, there isn't any good documentation except sparse
doxygen tags in source and source itself.

An useful example how to use this library is binary `dfsch-repl'
produced by compilation, it's source is `src/repl.c'. It's simple
interactive interpreter with some additional convenience features.

Interpreter depends on Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage
collector, in theory it is possible to replace all calls to GC_MALLOC
with malloc(3) for testing on platforms without working libgc (for
example Interix), but running any non-toy code without working GC is
not good idea. Console I/O library (used by REPL and debugger) is able
to use readline, but can reasonably work without it.

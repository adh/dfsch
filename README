This is dfsch - dfox's scheme implementation. It's essentialy an
embeddable scheme interpreter. For now it's still lacking many
scheme functions, but it's generally usable as embedded scripting
language.

Also, for now, there isn't any good documentation except sparse
doxygen tags in source and source itself.

The big interop idea:
* Optimized weak-key-hash
* Multiple inheritance (at least for user-defined classes, somehow)

Bugfixes:

nearterm:
* compact-list collection constructor
* define-method as core-lib macro
* weak-value-hash
* weak-list (set?)
* python-like iter() with sentinel
* Iterator building blocks

0.4.1:
* encodings
* user defined collections, sequences, mappings, ports
  - overriding of type methods
* Allow at least call-next-method in methods with C wrapper
* Futures
* batch compiler
  - package API as special forms or something

Non-version-specific:
* More tests
* Documentation

0.4.x fetaures
* Pretty-printer
* Parser rewrite (recursive descent)
  - read macros
* non-trivial loop

Sometimes:
* Unicode
   - Normalization
   - Collation

External modules and libraries:
* Sound I/O
* DOM-like API on top of SXML
* AMQP
* Zbar

Non-version-specific:
* More tests
* Documentation
* Packages (reasonable implementation is probably simpler than it looks)

For 0.2.2:
* RELEASE

For 0.2.3:
* Missing format directives (c and f)
* Better writer (callback based)

For 0.2.4:
* Pretty-printer
* Multimethods + method combinations

For 0.2.x:
* Dynamic variables

For 0.3:
* Compiler (into bytecode)

For 0.4:
* JIT (using GNU Lightning)

When needed by other code:
* Type predicates for all types
* Structures (in C code)

Sometimes:
* Unicode
   - Normalization
   - Collation
* syntax-rules
* Missing parts of unix library (ftw, various system databases...)

External modules and libraries:
* JSON
* Sound I/O
* FFI

Application of NIL leads to NIL, is this correct?

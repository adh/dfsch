Non-version-specific:
* More tests

For 0.2.0:
* Simplified IO (something along the lines of scheme ports, but not
   fully compatible)
* Missing parts of unix library (notably dirent.h and friends)
* What about standard C functions related to OS?
* Documentation

For 0.2.1:
* Generic functions

When needed by other code:
* Type predicates for all types
* Warnings
* Structures (in C code)

Sometimes:
* Some platform- and locale-independent conversion of numbers from/to strings
* Unicode case-insensitive string compare
* More number types:
  - Big integers
  - Fractions
  - Complex numbers (as pairs of two numbers of same type)
* Read macros (at least rudimentary, useful for example for include-like 
  constructs with path relative to file they are in as this is near impossible 
  to implement outside parser.)

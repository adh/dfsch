* IO
* Documentation
* Some platform- and locale-independent conversion of numbers from/to strings
* Warnings
* Structures (in C code)
* Unicode case-insensitive string compare
* More number types:
  - Big integers
  - Fractions
  - Complex numbers (as pairs of two numbers of same type)
* More tests
* Read macros (at least rudimentary, useful for example for include-like 
  constructs with path relative to file they are in as this is near impossible 
  to implement outside parser.)
* unwind-protect (and probably unify escape continuations and
   exceptions)

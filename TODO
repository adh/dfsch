Non-version-specific:
* More tests
* Documentation
* Packages (reasonable implementation is probably simpler than it looks)

For 0.3.0:
* Missing format directives (c and f)
* Circular printer
* Pretty-printer
* apply-related optimalizations (reduce consing)
* pair classes (immutable, mutable, annotated)
* immutable pair and list constructors (copy, append...)
* function to verify mutability of whole list (e.g. for sort)

When needed by other code:
* Type predicates for all types
* Structures (in C code)

Sometimes:
* Unicode
   - Normalization
   - Collation
* syntax-rules
* Missing parts of unix library (ftw, various system databases...)

External modules and libraries:
* JSON
* Sound I/O
* FFI

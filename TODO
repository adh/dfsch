Non-version-specific:
* More tests

For 0.2.0:
* Documentation
* Conditions (Errors, Warnings, debugger hooks...)
* Better handling of locality of syntax errors

For 0.2.1:
* Generic functions
* Missing parts of unix library (ftw, various system databases...)
* Pretty-printer

When needed by other code:
* Type predicates for all types
* Structures (in C code)

Sometimes:
* Some platform- and locale-independent conversion of numbers from/to strings
* Unicode case-insensitive string compare
* More number types:
  - Big integers
  - Fractions
  - Complex numbers (as pairs of two numbers of same type)
* Read macros (at least rudimentary, useful for example for include-like 
  constructs with path relative to file they are in as this is near impossible 
  to implement outside parser.)
* syntax-rules
* Sound I/O
* Compiler

External modules and libraries:
* XML (SAX, SXML, DOM)
* JSON
* SQL database access (postgresql)

* More number types:
  - Big integers
  - Fractions
  - Complex numbers (as pairs of two numbers of same type)
* caaadadr and such weird functions (I've no idea how to implement this)
* IO
* Documentation for library API
* Documented semantics of locales
* Unicode case-insensitive string compare
* Some platform- and locale-independent conversion of numbers from/to strings
* Warnings
* Structures (in C code)
* Some object system (should be used for IO subsystem somehow)

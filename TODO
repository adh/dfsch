Non-version-specific:
* More tests

For 0.2.0:
* Simplified IO (something along the lines of scheme ports, but not
   fully compatible)
* Documentation
* Date and time handling
* Warnings
* Conditions

For 0.2.1:
* Generic functions
* Missing parts of unix library (ftw, various system databases...)
* Pretty-printer

When needed by other code:
* Type predicates for all types
* Structures (in C code)

Sometimes:
* Some platform- and locale-independent conversion of numbers from/to strings
* Unicode case-insensitive string compare
* More number types:
  - Big integers
  - Fractions
  - Complex numbers (as pairs of two numbers of same type)
* Read macros (at least rudimentary, useful for example for include-like 
  constructs with path relative to file they are in as this is near impossible 
  to implement outside parser.)
* Parser-level namespaces
* Use standard exception mechanism in parser
* syntax-rules

External modules and libraries:
* XML (SAX, SXML, DOM)
* JSON
* kyhttp/kyhttpd interface
* SQL database access (sqlite, postgresql)
